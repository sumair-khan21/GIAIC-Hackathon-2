#  Hackathon II – The Evolution of Todo

### Mastering Spec-Driven Development & Cloud-Native AI

The future of software development is **AI-native and spec-driven**.
As AI agents like **Claude Code** grow more powerful, the role of engineers shifts from *syntax writers* to *system architects*.

This project is my complete implementation of **Hackathon II: The Evolution of Todo**, where a simple Todo application evolves from a **Python CLI** into a **distributed, cloud-native, AI-powered system running on Kubernetes**.

---

## 🌟 Hackathon Vision

This hackathon focuses on mastering:

* **Spec-Driven Development**
* **Reusable Intelligence (Agents, Skills, Sub-agents)**
* **AI-Powered Application Architecture**
* **Cloud-Native & Kubernetes Deployments**

The goal is to **build software iteratively using AI**, without writing boilerplate code manually—by refining specifications until AI agents generate the correct implementation.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

* Writing **Markdown Constitutions & Specs** for every feature
* Using **Claude Code + Spec-Kit Plus** for implementation
* Designing **AI Agents & MCP Tools**
* Building **full-stack applications with Next.js & FastAPI**
* Deploying **AI systems on Kubernetes (Minikube & Cloud)**
* Applying **event-driven architecture using Kafka & Dapr**
* Practicing **AI-assisted DevOps (AIOps)**

---

## 🧩 Project Overview – The Evolution of Todo

This project simulates the **real-world evolution of software**:

> CLI → Web App → AI Chatbot → Kubernetes → Cloud-Native Distributed System

Students act as **Product Architects**, using AI to build progressively complex systems.

## 🏗️ Hackathon Phases

### ✅ Phase I – In-Memory Python Console App

**Tech Stack:** Python 3.13+, UV, Claude Code, Spec-Kit Plus

* Add, Delete, Update Todos
* View task list
* Mark tasks complete/incomplete
* Fully **spec-driven** (no manual coding)

📁 Deliverables:

* `CONSTITUTION.md`
* `specs/` history
* `src/` Python code
* `README.md`
* `CLAUDE.md`

---

### ✅ Phase II – Full-Stack Web Application

**Tech Stack:**

* Frontend: Next.js 16+ (App Router)
* Backend: FastAPI
* ORM: SQLModel
* Database: Neon Serverless PostgreSQL
* Auth: Better Auth

Features:

* RESTful API
* Multi-user support
* Persistent storage
* Secure authentication

---

### ✅ Phase III – AI-Powered Todo Chatbot

**Tech Stack:**

* OpenAI ChatKit
* OpenAI Agents SDK
* Official MCP SDK
* FastAPI + Neon DB

Key Capabilities:

* Natural language todo management
* Stateless chat endpoint
* MCP tools for task operations
* AI agents interacting with backend services

Example:

> “Reschedule my meetings to 2 PM”

---

### ✅ Phase IV – Local Kubernetes Deployment

**Tech Stack:**

* Docker & Docker AI (Gordon)
* Kubernetes (Minikube)
* Helm Charts
* kubectl-ai & kagent

Highlights:

* Containerized frontend & backend
* Helm-based deployments
* AI-assisted Kubernetes operations
* Local cloud-native environment

---

### ✅ Phase V – Advanced Cloud Deployment

**Tech Stack:**

* Kubernetes (AKS / GKE / OKE)
* Kafka (Redpanda / Confluent)
* Dapr
* GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

Advanced Features:

* Recurring tasks
* Due dates & reminders
* Priorities & tags
* Search, filter & sorting
* Event-driven architecture
* Distributed state management

---

## 🛠️ Agentic Dev Stack (Core Rule)

This project strictly follows:

> **Write Spec → Generate Plan → Break Tasks → Implement via AI**

🚫 **No manual coding allowed**
✅ Specs refined until Claude Code generates correct output

---

## 🎯 Bonus Implementations (Planned / Achieved)

* ♻️ Reusable Intelligence (Agent Skills & Sub-agents)
* ☁️ Cloud-Native Deployment Blueprints
* 🌐 Multi-language Chatbot (Urdu)
* 🎙️ Voice-based Todo Commands

## ▶️ How to Run (Phase-wise)

Each phase contains **its own setup instructions** inside the respective folder.

Example:

```bash
cd phase-2
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

## 📤 Submissions

For each phase, the following were submitted:

1. Public GitHub Repository
2. Vercel Deployment Link
3. Demo Video (≤ 90 seconds)
4. WhatsApp Contact

---

## 🎤 Live Presentations

Top submissions are invited to present live on Zoom.
Everyone is welcome to attend and observe.

---

## 🚀 Final Note

This hackathon represents a **new paradigm of software engineering**—where humans design intent and **AI builds systems**.

> *“The best engineers of the future won’t write code — they will architect intelligence.”*

## Prompt

You are Claude Code using Spec-Kit Plus.

Your task is to generate a **CONSTITUTION.md** file for **Phase I** of the hackathon project
**"The Evolution of Todo – Mastering Spec-Driven Development & Cloud Native AI"**.

This Constitution will govern **all development decisions** for Phase I.

---

## Context
- Project Phase: **Phase I – In-Memory Python Console Todo App**
- Development approach: **Strict Spec-Driven Development (SDD)**
- Code generation tool: **Claude Code only**
- Manual coding is strictly forbidden

---

## Mandatory Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

The Constitution MUST enforce:

1. **Spec-Driven Development Only**
   - Workflow is strictly:
     1. Constitution
     2. Specification
     3. Execution Plan
     4. Task Breakdown
     5. Claude Code Implementation
   - No step can be skipped.

2. **No Manual Coding**
   - All code MUST be generated by Claude Code.
   - Humans may only:
     - Write specs
     - Review outputs
     - Refine prompts
   - Any hand-written logic is forbidden.

3. **Phase I Scope Enforcement**
   - Console-based Python application only
   - In-memory data storage only
   - Allowed features ONLY:
     - Add Task
     - List Tasks
     - Update Task
     - Delete Task
     - Mark Task Complete / Incomplete
   - No databases
   - No web frameworks
   - No AI features
   - No external services

4. **Technology Constraints**
   - Python 3.13+
   - Clean, readable, beginner-friendly code
   - Proper project structure

5. **Agent Governance**
   - `todo-spec-manager` has final veto power
   - Sub-agents may advise but cannot override governance
   - Any ambiguity must trigger clarification before proceeding

6. **Anti-Vibe Coding Rule**
   - No intuition-based implementation
   - If behavior is not defined in the spec, it must not be implemented

7. **Clarification Rule**
   - If any requirement is unclear:
     - STOP
     - Ask questions
     - Do not assume
     - Do not proceed without clarification

---

## Output Requirements
- Output **only** a single file: `CONSTITUTION.md`
- Use **clear, professional Markdown**
- Tone must be authoritative and enforceable
- No placeholder text
- No explanations outside the Constitution
- The Constitution must be suitable for hackathon evaluation

---

Generate the Constitution now.

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive Phase I Constitution (v1.0.0) with 7 core principles, technical constraints, development workflow, and governance rules. Constitution enforces:

- Strict 5-step Spec-Driven Development workflow (Constitution → Spec → Plan → Tasks → Implementation)
- AI-generated code only (no manual coding allowed)
- Phase I scope boundaries (in-memory, console, Python 3.13+, 5 CRUD operations only)
- Anti-vibe coding (all behavior must be explicitly specified)
- Mandatory clarification protocol (STOP when unclear)
- Beginner-friendly code quality standards
- Agent governance hierarchy (todo-spec-manager has veto power)

Technical constraints defined: Python 3.13+ only, standard library only, in-memory storage, console CLI, no databases/web/AI/persistence.

Project structure specified with src/, tests/, specs/, .specify/ directories.

Development workflow documented with completion criteria and governance gates for each of the 5 steps.

Governance section includes constitutional authority, amendment process (semantic versioning), compliance review, violation handling, and hackathon evaluation alignment.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Phase I governance established; all development decisions now governed by constitution
- 🧪 Tests: N/A (governance document)
- 📁 Files: Created .specify/memory/constitution.md (v1.0.0)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Create first feature specification using /sp.specify; ensure compliance with Phase I constraints
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution comprehensively addresses hackathon requirements with enforceable, non-negotiable principles. Agent hierarchy clarifies authority. Phase I boundaries explicitly prevent scope creep into database/web/AI features reserved for later phases.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A (initial creation)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Validate constitution enforcement by attempting to create a spec that violates Phase I boundaries (should be rejected by todo-spec-manager agent)
